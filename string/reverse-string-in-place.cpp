/** @file reverse-string-in-place.cpp
 *  @brief 
 *
 *  Write a function to reverse a string in-place.
 *  Since strings in Python are immutable, first convert the string into a list of characters, 
 *  do the in-place reversal on that list, and re-join that list into a string before returning it. 
 *  This isn't technically "in-place" and the list of characters will cost O(n) additional space, 
 *  but it's a reasonable way to stay within the spirit of the challenge. 
 *  
 *  If you're comfortable coding in a language with mutable strings, that'd be even better!
 *
 *  @author Shawn Mullings (@shawnmullings)
 *  @bug No known bugs.
